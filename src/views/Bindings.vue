                <p>So we have learned that using the double curlies {{ }} allows us to run javascript code directly
                    from our html. We also know that we have access to our controller object and can get its properties
                    to render on the page as well.

                    Another method of bring in properties from our controller is to use another ng- directive called
                    ng-model</p>
